       consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
       whit photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and 
       parents make the right nutriotional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be 
       provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous mea choices
       and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
       eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
       Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy 
    humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
    management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the Inevitable and costly errors with manual data
    entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data
    <br>
    2. Economics
    Have you ever thought that attendence management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end
    to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
    of fact, a study done by the assium group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after 
    implimenting automated attendance management systems.
    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency
    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes 
    time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create 
    payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from 
    keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and 
    effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased 
    productivity and improves profits. It also increases many more like visibility / insights, Hassle free workflow 
    management, Flexibility, Integration / Configuration, Real-time tracking, Security, and Compliance.
